# Forest-Cover-Dataset-EDA
Exploratory Analysis on the Forest Cover Dataset

The aim was to build a model that can correctly predict type of cover based on various physical attributes like Soil type, Cover Elevation etc.,

Intial EDA was done on a sample of the dataset to get clearer insights. 

Involved creating various visualizations to establish relationship between the various attributes. It is pretty clear that all attributes are needed to predict the Cover_Type.
